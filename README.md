# Description
Stark Harness is a resource that allows for a persisent safety harness in all personally owned player vehicles.

## Installation
1. Add stark_harness to your resources folder for your server
2. Be sure to remove the '-main' from the end of the folder name
3. Customize the script to your liking in the Config!
4. Add ```ensure stark_harness``` to your server.cfg
5. Restart your server and enjoy!!

# Further Installation Steps
For your convenience, an amended version of ```qb-smallresources/client/seatbelt.lua``` has been provided for installation purposes for this resource. Please see the included **install** folder for this file & the item images and code for your server's inventory script!

## QB-Smallresources
1. In ```qb-smallresources/client/seatbelt.lua```, locate the following event: ```'seatbelt:client:UseHarness'```.

Replace it with the following snippet of code:
```lua
RegisterNetEvent('seatbelt:client:UseHarness', function(ItemData) -- On Item Use (registered server side)
    local ped = PlayerPedId()
    local inVeh = IsPedInAnyVehicle(ped, false)
    local class = GetVehicleClass(GetVehiclePedIsUsing(ped))
    if inVeh and class ~= 8 and class ~= 13 and class ~= 14 then
        if not harnessOn then
            LocalPlayer.state:set("inv_busy", true, true)
            QBCore.Functions.Progressbar("harness_equip", Lang:t('seatbelt.use_harness_progress'), 5000, false, true, {
                disableMovement = false,
                disableCarMovement = false,
                disableMouse = false,
                disableCombat = true,
            }, {}, {}, {}, function()
                LocalPlayer.state:set("inv_busy", false, true)
                toggleHarness()
                if updateInfo then TriggerServerEvent('equip:harness', ItemData) end
            end)
            if updateInfo then
                harnessHp = ItemData.info.uses
                harnessData = ItemData
                TriggerEvent('hud:client:UpdateHarness', harnessHp)
            end
        else
            harnessOn = false
            toggleSeatbelt()
        end
    else
        QBCore.Functions.Notify(Lang:t('seatbelt.no_car'), 'error')
    end
end)
```

2. In ```qb-smallresources/client/seatbelt.lua```, locate the following command: ```'toggleseatbelt'```.

Replace it with the following snippet of code:

```lua
RegisterCommand('toggleseatbelt', function()
    if not IsPedInAnyVehicle(PlayerPedId(), false) or IsPauseMenuActive() then return end
    local class = GetVehicleClass(GetVehiclePedIsUsing(PlayerPedId()))
    if class == 8 or class == 13 or class == 14 then return end
    local vehicle = GetVehiclePedIsIn(PlayerPedId(), false)
    local plate = QBCore.Functions.GetPlate(vehicle)
    TriggerServerEvent('stark_harness:server:toggleSeatBelt', plate)
end, false)

RegisterKeyMapping('toggleseatbelt', 'Toggle Seatbelt', 'keyboard', 'B')
```

3. In ```qb-smallresources/client/seatbelt.lua```, add the following event after ```'seatbelt:client:UseHarness'```:

```lua
RegisterNetEvent('seatbelt:client:UseSeatbelt', function()
    toggleSeatbelt()
end)
```

4. In ```qb-smallresources/client/seatbelt.lua```, replace the following lines

```lua
harnessHp -= 1
TriggerServerEvent('seatbelt:DoHarnessDamage', harnessHp, harnessData)
```

with the following snippet of code:

```lua
TriggerServerEvent('stark_harness:server:damageHarness', -1)
```

For reference, the following lines should be changed if using the latest version of qb-smallresources: 129, 139, 151, and 161.

5. In ```qb-smallresources/client/seatbelt.lua```, locate the following:

```lua
---Checks whether the player has their seatbelt on or not
---@return boolean
local function hasSeatbeltOn()
    return seatbeltOn
end

exports("HasSeatbeltOn", hasSeatbeltOn)
```

and replace it with the following snippet of code:

```lua
---Checks whether you have the seatbelt on or not
---@return boolean
local function hasSeatbelt()
    return seatbeltOn
end

exports("hasSeatbelt", hasSeatbelt)
```

6. In ```qb-smallresources/server/main.lua```, locate the following:

```lua
QBCore.Functions.CreateUseableItem('harness', function(source, item)
    TriggerClientEvent('seatbelt:client:UseHarness', source, item)
end)
```

and replace it with the following snippet of code:

```lua
QBCore.Functions.CreateUseableItem('harness', function(source, item)
    TriggerClientEvent('stark_harness:client:installHarness', source, item)
end)
```

7. If you want to add a special harness removal tool, add the following snippet of code to ```qb-smallresources/server/main.lua``` after the harness useable item:

```lua
QBCore.Functions.CreateUseableItem('removal_tool', function(source, item)
    TriggerClientEvent('stark_harness:client:removeHarness', source, item)
end)
```

8. You must run the provided harness.sql in your server's database to ensure successful operation of the script. OR you may execute the following qwery in your server's database:

```sql
ALTER TABLE player_vehicles ADD COLUMN `harness` VARCHAR(50) NULL;
```

9. If you would like to have the option to exit your vehicle without first undoing the seatbelt or harness, in ```qb-smallresources/client/seatbelt.lua```, locate ```function SeatBeltLoop()``` and replace it with the following snippet of code:

```lua
function SeatBeltLoop()
    CreateThread(function()
        while true do
            sleep = 1000
            if IsPedInAnyVehicle(PlayerPedId(), false) then
                sleep = 0
                if seatbeltOn or harnessOn then
                    if IsControlJustPressed(0, 75) then
                        seatbeltOn = false
                        harnessOn = false
                    end
                end
            else
                seatbeltOn = false
                harnessOn = false
            end
            Wait(sleep)
        end
    end)
end
```
